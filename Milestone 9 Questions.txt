Milestone 9 Questions

Compare and contrast TDD to pseudocode. When would you feel like using one versus the other?

TDD or Test Driven Development is a software development process in which the engineers write tests for the functions, classes, methods, etc. for the software they are developing. Then they try to write corresponding functions, classes, methods, etc. that can pass those tests. On the other hand, Pseudocode, or Documentation Driven Development, goes for a more top down approach. A general high level explanation of what the program is supposed to do is given. Then comments for the various classes, methods, and functions are written. After that, comments which give a general overview of what is suppose to be happening inside of those classes, methods, and functions is provided. Finally, the actual code is written and paired with the corresponding explanations. It seems to me that Psyedocode would be pretty advantageous in a large scale project in which a very clear and comprehensive vision needs to be established. TDD seems like it would be great in add ons or extenions to a project. Ultimately, I don't think these two methods are mutually exclusive and, most likely, would probably work well in tandem.
